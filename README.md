# Battleships
Introduction to programming
A single player version of Battlehips - This was the first program I ever wrote
----------------------------------------------------------------
Python version: 3.8.5
Tkinter version: 8.6

Run main_and_structure, the following files need to be in the same folder:

main_and_structure.py
class_board.py
functions_battleship.py
text_UI.py
high_scores_stored.txt
sizes.txt


Number of ships can be changed in sizes.txt by following the format:
"size size size size" for each ship desired. Size of board can be changed in class_board.py
by changing self.x and self.y to desired values. Only square boards. 


High scores can be manually changed in high_scores_stored.txt following the format:
"name -  numb", for example: 
"Juan -  66.7,Jonas -  59.3,Ella -  51.6,Jonas -  48.5"
Note the rounding and spacing. An existing highscore is required to play the game
